 * The investor portal — the one place outsiders sign in.

 * Every role this plugin had before belonged to somebody who works for BHELA. This is
 * the first that does not, and that changes the threat model: an investor is a real
 * person with a real login who has a financial interest in figures they cannot be
 * allowed to edit, and no business at all seeing another investor's bank details.
 *
 * The whole security model is one function. **bhela_bm_current_investor() resolves
 * the viewer's record from their user id and nothing else.** No investor id is ever
 * read from a URL, a form, or a cookie, so there is no id to tamper with — the
 * classic "change the number in the address bar" attack has nothing to change.
 * Scoping by hiding UI would leave the data one crafted request away; scoping at the
 * resolver means a wrong id cannot even be expressed.
 *
 * The portal is READ-ONLY. It writes nothing, ever. An investor who disputes a figure
 * takes it up with the office, and the office corrects it with a reversal that leaves
 * a trail — which is the whole point of the ledger being append-only.
